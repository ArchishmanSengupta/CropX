<h2 align="center" id="Stepstofollow"> ⭐ Steps to follow :scroll:</h2>

<br>


### 1️⃣ Install The Apk into your Android Phone

You can download the apk from google drive and install the app by clicking <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ucf38VxNP3KwNJ4N3VGpvov22QzCSJtZ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>

<br>


### 2️⃣ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/CropX.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `CropX` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder  CropX
$ cd CropX
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3️⃣ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/CropX.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/CropX.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [CropX](https://github.com/ArchishmanSengupta/CropX) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArchishmanSengupta/CropX.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CropX.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CropX.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ArchishmanSengupta/CropX.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ArchishmanSengupta![CORPX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71402528/114308981-4df45f00-9b03-11eb-9928-8028aaf2bd15.jpg)
/CropX.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4️⃣ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `CropX` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5️⃣ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:
